# Week 7

## Weekly Review
- This week I had to write and run PHP code to demonstrate my understanding of a list of features. In addition to this I had 2 group meetings and made progress on Assignment 2.

## Learning Activities & Resources

- **Group meeting (Website Setup)**
  - Description: During this weeks meeting I setup our staging and live website and hosted them using AWS Lightsail. I also assigned the domain name U3Aonline.com. Additionally I changed the username and password of the sites back-end so that I could invite my group members. In the meeting we discussed workflow options and intend on building from this in our upcoming meeting.
    - [Group Trello](https://trello.com/b/fK7fAHKP/cp-3402-assignment-2-team-08)
   
- **PHP coding**
  - Description: In this task I used a combination of the lecture Power Point and generative AI to build and structure my PHP files. I learnt how to demonstrate Echo, Decisions, Repetition, Function and Include PHP features/skills.

- **Setting up PHP environment**
  - Description: In this task I set up my PHP local environment with the help of generative AI and a YouTube video. I first created a folder directory using command prompt where I housed my php files. From here I went to System Environment Variables in control pannel and added the directory link of the PHP app which I downloaded. I then inputed "php -S localhost:8000" to run th inbuild PHP server and could then access my php website files using: http://localhost:8000/filename.php.

## Content Insights

- **Setting up PHP environment**
  - Setting up the PHP environment involved creating a local development environment to run PHP files. This included setting up a directory structure, configuring system environment variables, and running a PHP server. This process would allow for easy and risk free tesing of PHP code in the future before deploying it to a live site and as a result was useful and I am glad I put in the time to learn how to do it.
    
- **PHP coding**
  - During PHP coding, I learned how to utilise various PHP features such as Echo, Decisions, Repetition, Functions, and Includes. These features are essential for building dynamic and interactive web applications and enhances my understanding of the functionality and usability of PHP-based websites.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- **Teamwork and collaboration**
  - The group meeting and work flow discussions helped me build my effective communication and teamwork skills. These skills are valuable in professional settings where collaboration is essential for project success.

- **Technical proficiency using PHP**
  - Developing technical proficiency in PHP through hands-on learning enhances my capability in the interactive web applications job sector.
