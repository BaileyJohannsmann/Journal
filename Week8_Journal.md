# Week 8

## Weekly Review
- This week, I had to complete some form of a learning experiment in addition to continuing group work for Assignment 2.

## Learning Experiment

### Hypothesis:
- Hypothesis: Writing a plan/agenda before each meeting would help provide structure or guidance when group concentration is lacking.

### Theory:
- Theory: The hypothesis aims to enhance group meeting productivity by providing structure to meetings when concentration begins to slip. Additionally, it is expected to help achieve desired meeting outcomes, thereby improving overall group performance.

### Test:
- Test: To assess this hypothesis, I created a list of personal objectives for each meeting and referred to them when discussions deviated. I compared the overall productivity and content quality of meetings with and without pre-established agendas.

### Results:
- Results: The experiment proved beneficial as productivity and work quality were significantly higher this week compared to previous weeks. I intend to continue this practice for future meetings and endeavors.

- **Group Meetings**
  - Description: This week's group meetings were successful in overcoming challenges and establishing a workflow pipeline.

## Content Insights

**Experiment content insights:**
- Throughout the experiment, it became evident that having a structured agenda significantly improved the flow and focus of our group meetings. By outlining specific objectives and topics to discuss beforehand, I was able to stay on track, resulting in more productive discussions and better decision-making processes. Additionally, the agenda served as a reference point for keeping discussions relevant and ensuring that all team members had the opportunity to contribute their ideas and concerns.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
