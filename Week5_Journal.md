# Week 5

## Weekly Review
- This week I was required to create a child theme for a WordPress site and create a post on my LinkedIn profile that outlines one lesson I've learned to date in this subject.

## Learning Activities & Resources

- **Learning about child themes**
  - Description: I learnt more about child themes and customisation by watching youtube videos and going through the lecture notes.
  - Resources:
    - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpc6FAsi7xI&ab_channel=FerdyKorpershoek): This video on child themes was particularly useful in understanding how to apply them in WordPress.


- **Learning about LinkedIn profile editing**
  - Description: I learnt how to edit and personalise my LinkedIn profile.
  - Resources:
    - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKGXHZaHEdA&ab_channel=HowToLiveable): This video helped me learn how to edit my LinkedIn profile and customise it to make it more personal.

- **Journaling review**
  - Description: I read through my graded journal comments from last week and thought of emprovements.

## Estimated Hours

- Learning about child themes: 1 hour
- Learning about LinkedIn profile editing 0.5 hours
- Journaling review: 0.5 hours
- Total: 2 hours of learning 

## Content Insights

- **Child themes**
  - I no longer had access to my Assignment WordPress site as I ran out of free student credits. I left the practical too late to recreate a WordPress site and then complete the practical. Instead of not doing the practical or doing a poor job I instead put time in to learn about child themes and I focussed more of my time to the creation of my LinkedIn profile and journal so that I could still achieve 4/8 for this weeks practical.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- **LinkedIn profile creation**
  - Creating my LinkedIn profile was a valuable task in relation to future employability as LinkedIn is a platform that employers look to when they are considering recruitment. I intend to add to this profile outside of this subject and use it when I apply for Engineering vacation work experience this year.
  
- **Self-Learning**
  - The utilisation of online platforms such as YouTube demonstated my commitment to self-directed learning, this is a trait that will help me in future employability and interview scenarios.
