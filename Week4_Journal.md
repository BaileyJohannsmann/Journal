- **Establishing Local Host**
  - Establishing a local host was not difficult as I incorectly completed Week 2's practical by using a local host instead of web host, so I just had to retrace my steps to get back to my Joomla website. I used a program called XAMPP and I had no difficulties once I followed the tutorial I linked above.
