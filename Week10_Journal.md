## Content Insights

- **Recording rehearsal and presentation**
  - Learning how to collaborate on a presentation in an online setting was a useful skill learned this week. Most of our group consists of external students, so we had to perform our rehearsals and presentations online. This required us to look into software options such as OBS that allows us to simultaneously stream our screens and cameras. We also had to look into software options which allowed us to combine all of our work and edit it so it is one succinct video.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- **Teamwork and collaboration**
  - The group meetings helped me build my effective communication and teamwork skills. These skills are valuable in professional settings where collaboration is essential for project success.

- **Technical proficiency using PHP**
  - Rehearsing presentations is a valuable skill I will continue to do in future employment opportunities. It allowed us to review the quality of our work and self-assess.
