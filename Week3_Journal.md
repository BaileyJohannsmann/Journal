## Content Insights

- **Establishing Local Host**
  - Despite the instructions stating that I could work directly on the live site online, I decided to establish a local host. In hindsight, I believe I should have waited until the following weeks when this will be covered further. I initially tried using Scotch Box and VirtualBox; however, I had issues with the Windows command prompt interface. Oracle VirtualBox indicated that I did establish a connection; however, I couldn't find how to establish usability. I then moved on and tried using software called XAMPP and found it much more intuitive. Although I managed to develop a Joomla website using a local host, there is one major issue which I still have. When it came time to submit the link for my Joomla website, I discovered that Lindsay wouldn't actually be able to view it as it's only viewable on my local host. I couldn't figure out how to address this issue prior to submission; however, now I understand why it was originally stated that I wasn't required to establish a local host this week. I submitted my link anyway and accompanied it with images so Lindsay can see I actually did what was required of me for this week's task.

- **Joomla Web Template Editing**
 - I spent too much time on establishing a local host, which was not even in the scope of this weeks practical requirements, that I didnt have enough time to create a polished website. In saying this, the task did state that it could be basic and I feel as though the startup concept is still obvious to the audience. 

- **Additional thoughts** 
 - This week's practical taught me that if I'm going to challenge myself by attempting to exceed the scope of the required task, I need to have better time management. In hindsight, I shouldn't have tried using a local host as I didn't give myself enough time, and this resulted in me having to provide images alongside my local host link so Lindsay could view my completion of the practical. Although I am disappointed, I do feel that I did meet the requirements of the practical and I will better manage my time moving forward.
  
- **Journaling**
  - I believe my review of last weeks Journaling following Lindsay's discussussion in the lecture, contributed to this weeks being better and more genuine.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- **Adaptability**
  - In making the switch from Scotch Box to XAMPP I displayed technical adaptability.

- **Self-Learning**
  - My utilisation of websites, Youtube and various forums demonstrated my comitment to self learning.
